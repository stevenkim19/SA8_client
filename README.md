### Accomplishments
I successfully implemented the following features: <br />
Front End <br />
-A search bar & submit button that creates a note and displays the title based
on the input <br />
-Notes that can be edited, deleted, and dragged even when firebase isn't running <br />
-Editable input bars for text and title with markdown features (inside note) <br />

Backend <br />
-A configured firebase that maintains & updates the title, text, and the x, y
coordinates of every note. <br />
-This firebase can also be written in by local changes from the front end. <br />

### Issues I faced
It was difficult to understand how to pass functions in react and to get
firebase working, but everything else went smoothy once I figured those two parts
out.
